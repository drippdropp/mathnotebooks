    "\n",
    "If we have a set, $A$, which contains elements, $a, b, c, d, e$ all of which are also sets containing other elements. If we want to describe the collection of all of the elements of all the elements of $A$, we would write it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bigcup_i A_i = a \\cup b \\cup c \\cup d \\cup e $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose that _all_ of the elements of $A$ contain unique elements themselves, so nothing in $a$ is in $b$ and nothing in $b$ is in $c$, etc. We can easily express that as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bigcap_i A_i = \\emptyset $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\emptyset$ is the empty set. It's a set with no elements. This means mutual exclusivity among all the elements of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you see $\\bigcap_i A_i = \\emptyset$, it means that every element of $A$ has elements which are unique to itself. Think about this as a square split in two sections, $S = \\{ a, b \\}$ where $a$ contains all of the points in the section $a$ and $b$ contains all of the points in section $b$. Since no point in $a$ is also in $b$ (think of a square on a coordinate plane split into two sections), the intersection of $a$ and $b$ would be the empty set. "
